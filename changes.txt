Version 1.2.3
Fleshing out the relic guns and adding some relic hulls. I don't have anything else planned for the relic stuff at the moment, but I'll add more if inspiration strikes.
New:
- MHD Driver
- Plasmatic Repeater
- Shrieker Torpedo Silo
- Shrieker Torpedo Rack
- Dadras-class destroyer
- Aizawa-class dreadnought
- Several relic weapon caches and hulls will be placed during sector generation.

Changes:
- Changed relic weapon/hull spawning- they now show up only in mercenary and scavenger fleets.
- added a loot cargo listener to ensure that Taipan VLS cells (and any other weapons with the SYSTEM tag) never end up in anyone's cargo, ever
- Rotary AM Flak: new sounds courtesy of meso, and significantly reworked explosion visual effects
- Wailer MRM Pod: increased flight time by 2 seconds to ensure it reaches its listed range even if fired directly away from the target. Reduced homing spread amount.
- Consolidated the Kommok and Odomodo bounties into a single bounty with a higher level requirement, difficulty, and a third weird Komodo. 
- Reduced the power of the Odomodo's damper to 90%. 
- Kommok and Odomodo are no longer guaranteed recoveries.
- Kommok now has Temporal Damper instead of Temporal Shell.

Version 1.2.2
- fixes an issue with the most recent combat activators version that caused some nozzle systems to never find valid targets
- cryocoolant manual targeting now considers a selected ally a valid target, even if they have zero flux
- harmonic dart cannon: improved sound and visual effects
- Taipan VLS: reduced ammo regeneration by 33%. Overbuffed this one last patch.
