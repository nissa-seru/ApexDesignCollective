New:
- Anaconda-class phase battlecruiser: Phase capital. It's pretty fast and has very heavy armor. System is Gravitic Shield, which decelerates or diverts incoming projectiles, and reduces incoming beam damage for a short duration.

Changes:
- Reduced some stat creep that had snuck in over time:
-- Gharial: Reduced dissipation (400 -> 375).
-- Caiman: Reduced dissipation (425 -> 400) and speed (85 -> 80).
-- Mamba: Reduced dissipation (350 -> 300) and speed (155 -> 120).
-- Lacerta: Reduced speed (150 -> 130).
-- Alligator: Reduced speed (65 -> 55).
-- Apotheosis: Reduced dissipation (950 -> 900).
-- Sunbeam: Reduced speed (40 -> 35).
- Entropy Consolidator (System on Caiman/Komodo): Further reduced projectile damage (150 -> 100), EMP (300 -> 250), and HP (300 -> 200). Turns out firing all the retaliation projectiles at once is a major upgrade.
- Fixed an issue where the Iguana and Goanna didn't have any visible variants for autofit.
- Arcspike Pod: Reduced range (1500 -> 1200). Dunno why these had more range than sabots.
- Toroid Mortar: Projectiles no longer arc to phased targets. Halved turn rate.
- Tachyon Inverter: Reduced sustained dps (360 -> 300), burst DPS (990 -> 800), and magazine size (4 shots -> 3 shots).
- Missiles no longer track phased targets unless ECCM is installed.
- Fixed a number of weapons that would create fork bombs when used on the Python.
- Phase ships (Anaconda, Python, Mamba) now have 50% increased CR degradation after PPT runs out to match vanilla phase ships.
- Range Synchronizer: Was a bit too niche (especially with Apex's generally rangematched guns), so now it works across all weapon sizes.
