Version 1.2.6- (IN DEVELOPMENT)
- if you're seeing this, this file has been pushed to github. the stuff below is just notes for me until it's released- please don't download the dev version and complain that things are missing or broken.

New:
- amazing music by haplogynae
- five and a half new guns
Two new in-faction weapons:
- Caedometric Flickerbeam 
- Ultrachromatic Torpedo
Two and a half new relic weapons:
- Honeybee Pod
- Shatter Canister (in both small and medium)
And one weapon for pirates:
- Nanoacid Foamer
Changes
- Plasmatic Repeater: this wasn't supposed to be 20 op. oops. it's 24 now. also reduced sustained dps to 300 and efficiency to 1.1
- Wailer MRM: slightly modified spread parameters and reduced missile HP (175 -> 120)
- MHD Driver: was doing the math wrong; is now doing the math right. This is a nerf.
- Fusion Beams: Explosion radius is no longer capped, but now scales with a square root function instead of a linear one. Most explosions should be around 50-200 in radius, with ships like the Invictus going up to around 350.
- Light Fusion Beam: Reworked stats; the short burst and low beam velocity made it useless with any sort of range boost. Beam velocity is now higher and burst duration is longer; the explosion is unchanged.
- Tachyon Inverter: Fixed an issue with the sound that could occur at low amounts of time dilation.
- Relic derelicts are no longer pristine.
- All relic weapons and derelicts are no longer are guaranteed to spawn in every playthrough. Now spawns 2 derelicts and 6 relic caches. Other drop sources (merc/scavenger fleets, exploration loot, historians) are unchanged.
- Added some hamster death causes for industrial evolution, and fixed some ships not being on the printing/reverse engineering whitelists.

Excession rework
- Dealing damage generates entropy. A small amount of entropy is continuously generated over time. 
- Stored entropy is automatically spent to regenerate damaged armor. 
- Armor regeneration is more effective at higher timeflow.
- Maximum armor damage reduction is 100%.
- Phase timeflow increases with flux level, up to 12x.
- Zero-flux boost always applies during phase.
- System consumes all stored entropy to increase

System instantly consumes all stored entropy and makes the entropic shredder spend flux instead of generate it. Increases all damage dealt and generates homing energy projectiles based on the amount of entropy consumed.

Version 1.2.5- save compatible
- Rotary AM Flak: Improved vfx performance. Spam them more, if you desire.
- Wailer MRM: Increased frag damage to 400 (previously 300) since it felt a little lackluster for 13 OP.
- Fixed a crash that would happen if you fired Shrieker torpedoes at ships that were faster than them
- Fixed a crash with Wailer missiles that would happen if you were unlucky (honestly idk but it's fixed)

Version 1.2.4- save compatible
Just some fixes.
- Added version requirement for Combat Activators to prevent a crash if you didn't update it to at least 1.1.0.
- Toroid Mortars: somehow 0.96 broke the projectile glow on these? fuckin weird. anyway, it's fixed
- Shrieker Torpedoes: Reduced damage to 600 HE + 400 frag and increased targeting spread by about 20%.
- Aizawa and Dadras now have custom system AI and should be much more aggressive about using their dampers.

Version 1.2.3- save compatible (requires new save to spawn relic caches and derelicts)
Fleshing out the relic guns and adding some relic hulls. I don't have anything else planned for the relic stuff at the moment, but I'll add more if inspiration strikes.
New:
- MHD Driver
- Plasmatic Repeater
- Shrieker Torpedo Silo
- Shrieker Torpedo Rack
- Dadras-class destroyer
- Aizawa-class dreadnought
- Several relic weapon caches and hulls will be placed during sector generation.

Changes:
- Changed relic weapon/hull spawning- they now show up only in mercenary and scavenger fleets.
- added a loot cargo listener to ensure that Taipan VLS cells (and any other weapons with the SYSTEM tag) never end up in anyone's cargo, ever
- Rotary AM Flak: new sounds courtesy of meso, and significantly reworked explosion visual effects
- Wailer MRM Pod: increased flight time by 2 seconds to ensure it reaches its listed range even if fired directly away from the target. Reduced homing spread amount.
- Consolidated the Kommok and Odomodo bounties into a single bounty with a higher level requirement, difficulty, and a third weird Komodo. 
- Reduced the power of the Odomodo's damper to 90%. 
- Kommok and Odomodo are no longer guaranteed recoveries.
- Kommok now has Temporal Damper instead of Temporal Shell.

Bugs Squashed:
- Fixed a rare crash with the Wailer MRM missile AI.

Version 1.2.2- save compatible
- fixes an issue with the most recent combat activators version that caused some nozzle systems to never find valid targets
- cryocoolant manual targeting now considers a selected ally a valid target, even if they have zero flux
- harmonic dart cannon: improved sound and visual effects
- Taipan VLS: reduced ammo regeneration by 33%. Overbuffed this one last patch.
