1.0.9: Yet Another Capital Battlecarrier

this one's different, I promise

New:
Ships:
- Sonora-class Siege Carrier: A heavy frontline carrier designed for bombarding stations and other heavy combatants. Has a pair of built-in Ultrachromatic Pulse Cannons for anti-station duties. Comes with Networked Targeting Array and Fleet Support Gantry as built-in hullmods. System: Defense Optimization Uplink; improves the armor and shields of nearby allies but prevents hard flux dissipation while active.
- Tuatara-class (LRM) Missile Destroyer: Equipped with a Thundercloud SLRM Launcher, which delivers a large spread of mines. Ammo types are swappable between disruptor (frag+emp), graviton (kinetic+flux), and harmonic (HE) through a hullmod, like the Crocodile. System: Arcmine Dispenser.

Hullmods: 
- Networked Targeting Array: Shares the ship's range bonuses with its strikecraft, but decreases their engagement range. Increases the base range of the ship's small and medium weapons based on how much OP was spent on fighters. Great for larger battlecarriers, but can be very OP-expensive to take full advantage of.

Weapons:
- Toroid Mortar: Medium energy. Fires a low-velocity unstable ring of plasma that explodes violently on contact or after reaching maximum range. Excellent damage potential, good efficiency, and relatively low sustained flux cost, but very poor projectile velocity.

Changes:
- Crocodile: Taipan VLS pods now correctly reset if the ship vents or overloads during the firing sequence. (thanks amazigh)
- Cryocoolant Projector: Now just increases flux dissipation by 30% (vs equal or smaller ships) or 15% (vs larger ships). A reduction to flux generation was only really useful if you intentionally overfluxed your ships a bit; dissipation is more useful across a wider variety of hulls and loadouts.
- Active Flare Projector: Now fires 2/3/4/5 flares per nozzle per activation instead of 3 for all ship sizes. 
- Bifurcation Device (system on the Python): Fixed infinite recursion issues with several ED Shipyards weapons.
- Gecko: Weapons now deal 25 extra energy damage on hit, helping out against shielded or armored fighters that could shrug off the frag damage.
- Faction: Reduced fleet size (5 -> 4)- they had one point too many in faction doctrine settings.
- Harmonic Dart Cannon: Increased debuff strength (7.5% -> 8%), duration (4s -> 5s) and maximum (75% -> 100%). Reduced rate of fire by ~20%. Slightly reduced projectile velocity (900 -> 800), spread per shot (3 -> 2), and maximum spread (9 -> 8).
- Disruption Propagator: Increased range (700 -> 800). It can rangematch with medium guns, as a treat. Projectile is certainly slow enough for it.
- Tachyon Inverter: Increased range (700 -> 800). Reduced efficiency (1.0 -> 1.1). I won't lie I just want this one to rangematch. Also it's a shotgun so, yknow, whatever.

TODO:

- touhou mod needs guns added to python system list
- ed shipyard too
- make python reapply on-fire scripting (see approlight phantom ammo feeder for reference)
- ultrachromatic pulse cannon: 900 energy, 2x burst, 0.66 eff, 6s refire. (200 flux/sec per gun)

NEEDS SPRITIN':
- Tuatara-class destroyer: Aiming for 13 DP. 2 nozzles.
	- Same rapid nozzle hullmod as komodo.
	- Equipped with (1? 2?) Thundercloud SLRM tubes. Thundercloud Strategic Long-Range Missiles deploy a cluster of mines at their targets. Mines produce a large but relatively weak shockwave. (250 energy[?], no falloff)
	- System is Arcmine Dispenser.
	- slots depend on missile firepower. low on PD because of arcmine system.
- Anaconda-class phase battlecruiser.
	- cryocooled armor
	- limited magazines
	- System: Temporal Siphon. Steals 20% of the timeflow from each hostile ship within range. 
	- Armament: 6x medium uni, 1x large uni, 4x small uni.
- Sonora-class siege carrier: Aiming for 50dp. 3 nozzles.
	- Siege Avionics: Increases the range of all fighter weapons by 50%, and all bomber weapons by 100%. Reduces fighter engagement range by 50%.
	- Fleet Repair Gantry: Increases fleet recovery rate by 25%. Each additional gantry provides half the benefit.
	- Armament: 2x Ultrachromatic Pulse Cannon, 4x wings, 1x large uni, 2x med synergy, 3x med hybrid (one rear-facing), PD mounts.
	- Ultrachromatic Pulse Cannon: 1k range, 2 barrels, 750 energy, 200 flux/sec, 7.5 reload. Poor accuracy on subsequent shots. Hits to shield heavily dampen velocity. Hits to armor reduce effective armor.
	- System: Fleet Reinforcement. Synchronizes fleet defense routines. Allied ships in range take less shield and armor damage. Prevents hard flux dissipation while active.
