- Defeat the blue corporate menace in three new missions.

Balance:
- Mamba: Increased DP (6 -> 8) and decreased OP (55 -> 50).

- Komodo: Reduced hull HP (11000 -> 10000).
- Temporal Damper (Caiman, Komodo, Apex): Decreased uptime (5s -> 4s) and chargeup/chargedown time (0.25s -> 0.1s).

- Boa-class phase destroyer: 20 DP. An anti-phase phase ship. System is Temporal Siphon, a toggleable system that steals a portion of any timeflow bonuses on nearby hostile ships but generates hard flux while active.
