Tachyon Drivers: Significantly reduced EMP damage. Had too much EMP DPS for their range after the buff.
Geodesic Shield Matrix: Frag damage that penetrates the shield remains frag damage instead of being converted to energy (vulcans were far too good at shredding armor through the shield).
Gecko Interceptor Wing: Increased armor (100 -> 150)
Anole Heavy Fighter Wing: Buffed these a bit to justify their cost. Increased armor (200 -> 250) and hull (700 -> 750), slighly improved coilgun total DPS (~180 -> 200), improved fusion beam DPS by increasing the rate of fire, shifting more damage into the on-hit effect, and decreased replacement time (18s -> 15s).


Changes:
- Lacerta: Increased max flux (2500 -> 3000) to bring its effective HP more in line with other high-end frigates.
- Tachyon Drivers: Increased range by 200, to 700/800 for the small/medium. Removed magazine system from small. Increased re-fire time to 1.5 sec. Excellent range for energy weapons, but poor projectile velocity and armor penetration. Useful for ships that want to rangematch ballistics with energies.
Fixes:
- Reworked the "add to existing save" functionality, hopefully fixing a rare bug that could cause Apex to reset its relations with other factions.

Todo, eventaully:
- Tuatara-class destroyer. 13 DP. Basically half a Crocodile. Two Taipan-6 missile pods and three nozzles. System is Arcmine Dispenser.
- Anaconda-class phase battlecruiser. System is temporal siphon; steals timeflow from nearby ships. Probably 1x large, 6x med?
- consider a line of synergy weapons (toroid mortars)
	- energy stats, fires a slow, guided, interceptable plasma ring
	- big aoe, real good energy damage (1000/shot, regens 1 every 10s?)
- Sonora-class utility cruiser. 1x large uni hardpoint, 2x medium energy, some PD mounts, 1x bay. Salvage gantry, repair gantry hullmod. Good base speed, probably? Maybe a lighter cruiser than the alligator.
