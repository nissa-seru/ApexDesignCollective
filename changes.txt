Komodo: Replaced temporal damper with retaliatory damper, which fires homing retaliatory projectiles at enemies when it takes damage.
Fusion Beams: Now require 0.5 seconds of uninterrupted armor damage to trigger the explosion.
Nanoacid Cannons: Significantly increased projectile velocity.
Inversion Beam: Improved EMP damage and arc rate; roughly half as good as an ion cannon now.
Coherency Amplifier: Fixed an issue where flak QGPD shots would deal the energy damage every frame the explosion existed.


Todo before next release:
- Tuatara-class destroyer: 13 DP. Basically half a Crocodile. Two Taipan-6 missile pods and three nozzles. System is Arcmine Dispenser.
- Boa-class phase destroyer: 20 DP. An anti-phase phase ship. System is Temporal Siphon, a toggleable system that steals a portion of any timeflow bonuses on nearby hostile ships but generates hard flux while active.
- consider a line of synergy weapons (toroid mortars)
	- energy stats, fires a slow, guided, interceptable plasma ring
	- big aoe, decent energy damage (400/shot, regens 1 every 10s?)
- strategic cruiser (35 dp?)
	- core (system, speed)
		- Core: Dilation Engine
			- temporal damper, 40 speed
		- Core: Inertial Dissipator
			- heavy inertial skimmer, 70 speed
		- Core: Rapid Assembler
			- arcmine dispenser (8x), builtin wing?, 60 speed
	- offensive (weapons, flux diss, OP)
		- Offensive: Multiplex Targeter
			- 16ish small hybrids (8? converge), 2 medium missiles, +300 range and +25% damage for small projectile weapons, augmented range synch
		- Offensive: Assault Matrix
			- 6 medium hybrids, 4 small energies, +33% rate of fire and ammo regen, -25% flux cost.
		- Offensive: Taipan Fabricator
			- 3x 3x3 taipan launchers, variable warheads, two large hybrids, one medium uni, 4 small energies
	- defensive (armor)
		- Defensive: Armor Reinforcement
			- increases armor rating by 33%.
		- Defensive: Support Processor
			- Counts as a capital ship when applying cryocoolant or remote repairs to allies.
		- Defensive: Interception Array
			- Increases PD rate of fire by 33%, increases damage to missiles and fighters by 33%.
