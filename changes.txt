1.0.9: Yet Another Capital Battlecarrier

this one's different, I promise

New:
Ships:
- Sonora-class Siege Carrier: A heavy frontline carrier designed for bombarding stations and other heavy combatants. Has a pair of built-in Ultrachromatic Pulse Cannons for anti-station duties. Comes with Networked Targeting Array and Fleet Support Gantry as built-in hullmods. System: Defense Optimization Uplink; improves the armor and shields of nearby allies but prevents hard flux dissipation while active.
- Tuatara-class (LRM) Missile Destroyer: Equipped with a Thundercloud LRM Launcher, which delivers a spread of high-AoE energy mines to its target. Excels at suppressing enemy formations, but lacks the focused damage needed to be effective against armor. System: Arcmine Dispenser.

Hullmods: 
- Networked Targeting Array: Shares the ship's range bonuses with its strikecraft, but decreases their engagement range. Increases the base range of the ship's small and medium weapons based on how much OP was spent on fighters. Great for larger battlecarriers, but can be very OP-expensive to take full advantage of.

Weapons:
- Toroid Mortar: Medium energy. Fires a low-velocity unstable ring of plasma that explodes violently on contact or after reaching maximum range. Excellent damage potential, good efficiency, and relatively low sustained flux cost, but very poor projectile velocity.

Thundercloud LRM: Splits into 6x250 energy damage mines. Mines detonate when approached or after a short timer, dealing their damage over a large area. The total damage from each mine is divided over up to 5 hits, with closer targets taking larger and fewer hits.

Changes:
- Crocodile: Taipan VLS pods now correctly reset their firing order if the ship vents or overloads during the firing sequence. (thanks amazigh)
- Komodo: Reduced flux dissipation by 50 and slightly reduced primary weapon arcs.
- Entropy Consolidator (system on Caiman and Komodo): Normalized damage taken multiplier to match the vanilla damper field. Destroyers now take 66% less damage and cruisers take 50% less damage (previous value was 60% for all hulls) and the description no longer lies about how strong the effect is.
- Cryocoolant Projector: Now just increases flux dissipation by 25% (vs equal or smaller ships) or 12.5% (vs larger ships). A reduction to flux generation was only really useful if you intentionally overfluxed your ships a bit; dissipation is more useful across a wider variety of hulls and loadouts.
- Bifurcation Device (system on the Python): Fixed infinite recursion issues with several ED Shipyards weapons.
- Gecko: Weapons now deal 25 extra energy damage on hit, helping out with shielded or armored targets that could shrug off the frag damage.

TODO:

- touhou mod needs guns added to python system list
- ed shipyard too
- make python reapply on-fire scripting (see approlight phantom ammo feeder for reference)
- ultrachromatic pulse cannon: 900 energy, 2x burst, 0.66 eff, 6s refire. (200 flux/sec per gun)

NEEDS SPRITIN':
- Tuatara-class destroyer: Aiming for 13 DP. 2 nozzles.
	- Same rapid nozzle hullmod as komodo.
	- Equipped with (1? 2?) Thundercloud SLRM tubes. Thundercloud Strategic Long-Range Missiles deploy a cluster of mines at their targets. Mines produce a large but relatively weak shockwave. (250 energy[?], no falloff)
	- System is Arcmine Dispenser.
	- slots depend on missile firepower. low on PD because of arcmine system.
- Anaconda-class phase battlecruiser.
	- cryocooled armor
	- limited magazines
	- System: Temporal Siphon. Steals 20% of the timeflow from each hostile ship within range. 
	- Armament: 6x medium uni, 1x large uni, 4x small uni.
- Sonora-class siege carrier: Aiming for 50dp. 3 nozzles.
	- Siege Avionics: Increases the range of all fighter weapons by 50%, and all bomber weapons by 100%. Reduces fighter engagement range by 50%.
	- Fleet Repair Gantry: Increases fleet recovery rate by 25%. Each additional gantry provides half the benefit.
	- Armament: 2x Ultrachromatic Pulse Cannon, 4x wings, 1x large uni, 2x med synergy, 3x med hybrid (one rear-facing), PD mounts.
	- Ultrachromatic Pulse Cannon: 1k range, 2 barrels, 750 energy, 200 flux/sec, 7.5 reload. Poor accuracy on subsequent shots. Hits to shield heavily dampen velocity. Hits to armor reduce effective armor.
	- System: Fleet Reinforcement. Synchronizes fleet defense routines. Allied ships in range take less shield and armor damage. Prevents hard flux dissipation while active.
