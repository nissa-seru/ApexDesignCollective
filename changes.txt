New:
- Iguana-class Frigate: A medium frigate with four Taipan VLS tubes. System is Rapid Loader, which instantly reloads 20 seconds worth of ammo regeneration.
- Goanna-class Heavy Cruiser: A familiar-looking cruiser design. System is Pursuit Mode, which improves damage output, forward speed, and maneuverability for a short duration.
- [REDACTED]. A very difficult late-game bounty. Check the bounty boards at Collective markets if you're at least level 10. It's not player-acquirable, before you get your hopes up.

Changes:
- Translation: Externalized all strings to /data/strings.json to support translation.
- Komodo: Actually reduced dissipation (750 -> 700). Had this in a previous changelog but somehow didn't actually do it. Whoops.
- Spectrum: Upgraded its two front small energy mounts to universals.
- Apotheosis: Increased spawn weight to about 1/8 of the Eidolon's (from 1/40).
- Light Burst Coilgun: Reduced burst DPS (200 -> 150), and slightly reduced projectile velocity (1200 -> 1100) to reflect its shorter barrel.
- Entropy Consolidator (Caiman, Komodo): Now fires retaliatory projectiles at the end of the active period instead of during it. Reduced damage/EMP/projectile HP (200/400/400 -> 150/300/300) and capped the number of projectiles the system can fire.
- Damper Systems (Summit, Caiman, Komodo): Shieldless ships should now be more aggressive with system use.
- Inertial Skimmers (Alligator, Eidolon): Rewrote AI (and by "rewrote" I mean "stole code"); ships should now be more intelligent with system use.
- Rapid Loader (Iguana, Crocodile): Reduced flux cost to activate (10% -> 7.5%).
- Travel Drive (Photon, Agama): Significantly reduced chargeup time. AI should be much less cautious with system use.

Bugfix
- Fixed an issue where Networked Targeting Array didn't ignore deco weapons.
