Version 1.2.7- save compatible
Really fucked up some of the relic generation code last version. It is fixed now. If you continue a save that you started in 1.2.6, please save your game before trying to open a relic cache because there's a non-zero chance it's bugged and will crash.

Since I feel bad about a bug like that, I have reworked the Excession to actually require a tiny bit of skill.
- You can no longer get two of them by doing the Nex start option.
- It's still vaguely similar (deal damage -> get juice -> use juice) but has some major changes.

Version 1.2.6- save compatible 
(new relic weapons will not show up in caches in existing saves)
New:
- incredible music by @haplogynae
- Caedometric Flickerbeam (in-faction)
- Nanoacid Foamer (pirates)
- Shatter Canister, Shatter Canister Pod (relics)
Changes
- Plasmatic Repeater: this wasn't supposed to be 20 op. oops. it's 24 now. also reduced sustained dps to 300 and efficiency to 1.1
- Wailer MRM: slightly modified spread parameters and reduced missile HP (175 -> 120)
- MHD Driver: was doing the math wrong; is now doing the math right. This is a nerf.
- Fusion Beams: Explosion radius is no longer capped, but now scales with a square root function instead of a linear one. Most explosions should be around 50-200 in radius, with ships like the Invictus going up to around 350.
- Light Fusion Beam: Reworked stats; the short burst and low beam velocity made it useless with any sort of range boost. Beam velocity is now higher and burst duration is longer; the explosion is unchanged.
- Tachyon Inverter: Fixed an issue with the sound that could occur at low amounts of time dilation.
- Relic derelicts are no longer pristine.
- All relic weapons and derelicts are no longer are guaranteed to spawn in every playthrough. Now spawns 2 derelicts and 6 relic caches. Ships got moved up a tier in historian drops, weapons unchanged.
- Added some hamster death causes for industrial evolution, and fixed some ships not being on the printing/reverse engineering whitelists.

Version 1.2.5- save compatible
- Rotary AM Flak: Improved vfx performance. Spam them more, if you desire.
- Wailer MRM: Increased frag damage to 400 (previously 300) since it felt a little lackluster for 13 OP.
- Fixed a crash that would happen if you fired Shrieker torpedoes at ships that were faster than them
- Fixed a crash with Wailer missiles that would happen if you were unlucky (honestly idk but it's fixed)

Version 1.2.4- save compatible
Just some fixes.
- Added version requirement for Combat Activators to prevent a crash if you didn't update it to at least 1.1.0.
- Toroid Mortars: somehow 0.96 broke the projectile glow on these? fuckin weird. anyway, it's fixed
- Shrieker Torpedoes: Reduced damage to 600 HE + 400 frag and increased targeting spread by about 20%.
- Aizawa and Dadras now have custom system AI and should be much more aggressive about using their dampers.

Version 1.2.3- save compatible (requires new save to spawn relic caches and derelicts)
Fleshing out the relic guns and adding some relic hulls. I don't have anything else planned for the relic stuff at the moment, but I'll add more if inspiration strikes.
New:
- MHD Driver
- Plasmatic Repeater
- Shrieker Torpedo Silo
- Shrieker Torpedo Rack
- Dadras-class destroyer
- Aizawa-class dreadnought
- Several relic weapon caches and hulls will be placed during sector generation.

Changes:
- Changed relic weapon/hull spawning- they now show up only in mercenary and scavenger fleets.
- added a loot cargo listener to ensure that Taipan VLS cells (and any other weapons with the SYSTEM tag) never end up in anyone's cargo, ever
- Rotary AM Flak: new sounds courtesy of meso, and significantly reworked explosion visual effects
- Wailer MRM Pod: increased flight time by 2 seconds to ensure it reaches its listed range even if fired directly away from the target. Reduced homing spread amount.
- Consolidated the Kommok and Odomodo bounties into a single bounty with a higher level requirement, difficulty, and a third weird Komodo. 
- Reduced the power of the Odomodo's damper to 90%. 
- Kommok and Odomodo are no longer guaranteed recoveries.
- Kommok now has Temporal Damper instead of Temporal Shell.

Bugs Squashed:
- Fixed a rare crash with the Wailer MRM missile AI.

Version 1.2.2- save compatible
- fixes an issue with the most recent combat activators version that caused some nozzle systems to never find valid targets
- cryocoolant manual targeting now considers a selected ally a valid target, even if they have zero flux
- harmonic dart cannon: improved sound and visual effects
- Taipan VLS: reduced ammo regeneration by 33%. Overbuffed this one last patch.
