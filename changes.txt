New:
- Iguana-class Frigate: A medium frigate with four Taipain VLS tubes. System is Rapid Loader.
- Goanna-class Heavy Cruiser: A familiar-looking cruiser design. System is Pursuit Mode, which significantly improves forward speed and acceleration for a moderate duration.
- [REDACTED]. A very difficult late-game bounty. Check the bounty boards at Collective markets if you're at least level 10. Not player-acquirable, before you get your hopes up.

Changes:
- Translation: Externalized all strings to /data/strings.json to support translation.
- Komodo: Actually reduced dissipation (750 -> 700). Had this in a previous changelog but somehow didn't actually do it. Whoops.
- Entropy Consolidator (Caiman, Komodo): Now fires retaliatory projectiles at the end of the active period instead of during it. Reduced damage/EMP/projectile HP (200/400/400 -> 150/300/300).
- Damper Systems (Temporal Damper, Entropy Consolidator): Shieldless ships should now be more aggressive with system use.
TODO- Inertial Skimmers (Alligator, Eidolon): Rewrote AI; ships should now be more intelligent with system use.
- Rapid Loader (Iguana, Crocodile): Reduced flux cost to activate (10% -> 7.5%).
- Travel Drive (Photon, Agama): Significantly reduced chargeup time. AI should be much less cautious with system use.

Bugfix
- Fixed an issue where Networked Targeting Array didn't ignore deco weapons.
