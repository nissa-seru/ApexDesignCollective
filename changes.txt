- Fixed a Komodo variant having too much OP
- Fuel and cargo carrier refits now reduce supply cost by a multiplier instead of a flat amount (avoids issues with expanded holds/tanks)

Todo before next release:
- consider a line of synergy weapons (toroid mortars)
- Backscatter light carrier: A two-wing destroyer carrier. Like the Spectrum, it can be converted to carry cargo or fuel. System is Remote Temporal Damper.
- Photon ultralight transport: A dirt-cheap and lightning-fast frigate hauler, solely useful for being nearly impossible to catch. Comes in cargo, fuel, and personnel configurations. System is Travel Drive.
- Backscatter (CIV-F) and Backscatter (CIV-C)
