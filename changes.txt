Version 1.2.5- save compatible
- Rotary AM Flak: Improved vfx performance. Spam them more, if you desire.
- Wailer MRM: Increased frag damage to 400 (previously 300) since it felt a little lackluster for 13 OP.
- Fixed a crash that would happen if you fired Shrieker torpedoes at ships that were faster than them
- Fixed a crash with Wailer missiles that would happen if you were unlucky (honestly idk but it's fixed)

Version 1.2.4- save compatible
Just some fixes.
- Added version requirement for Combat Activators to prevent a crash if you didn't update it to at least 1.1.0.
- Toroid Mortars: somehow 0.96 broke the projectile glow on these? fuckin weird. anyway, it's fixed
- Shrieker Torpedoes: Reduced damage to 600 HE + 400 frag and increased targeting spread by about 20%.
- Aizawa and Dadras now have custom system AI and should be much more aggressive about using their dampers.

Version 1.2.3- save compatible (requires new save to spawn relic caches and derelicts)
Fleshing out the relic guns and adding some relic hulls. I don't have anything else planned for the relic stuff at the moment, but I'll add more if inspiration strikes.
New:
- MHD Driver
- Plasmatic Repeater
- Shrieker Torpedo Silo
- Shrieker Torpedo Rack
- Dadras-class destroyer
- Aizawa-class dreadnought
- Several relic weapon caches and hulls will be placed during sector generation.

Changes:
- Changed relic weapon/hull spawning- they now show up only in mercenary and scavenger fleets.
- added a loot cargo listener to ensure that Taipan VLS cells (and any other weapons with the SYSTEM tag) never end up in anyone's cargo, ever
- Rotary AM Flak: new sounds courtesy of meso, and significantly reworked explosion visual effects
- Wailer MRM Pod: increased flight time by 2 seconds to ensure it reaches its listed range even if fired directly away from the target. Reduced homing spread amount.
- Consolidated the Kommok and Odomodo bounties into a single bounty with a higher level requirement, difficulty, and a third weird Komodo. 
- Reduced the power of the Odomodo's damper to 90%. 
- Kommok and Odomodo are no longer guaranteed recoveries.
- Kommok now has Temporal Damper instead of Temporal Shell.

Bugs Squashed:
- Fixed a rare crash with the Wailer MRM missile AI.

Version 1.2.2- save compatible
- fixes an issue with the most recent combat activators version that caused some nozzle systems to never find valid targets
- cryocoolant manual targeting now considers a selected ally a valid target, even if they have zero flux
- harmonic dart cannon: improved sound and visual effects
- Taipan VLS: reduced ammo regeneration by 33%. Overbuffed this one last patch.
