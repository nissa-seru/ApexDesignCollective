Changes:
- Networked Targeting Array: now caps fighter weapon range at 2000 units.
- Cryocoolant now says +X% dissipation instead of -X% (effect was correct, though)
- Sunbeam: Bumped up to 55 DP. Fixed a mount that was pointed in the wrong direction. Significantly improved computational performance.
- Thunderstorm SLRM Missiles: Reworked mine explosion effects; sunglasses no longer required.
- Added Exiled Space config. 
- Excession: Reworked [redacted], now actually looks at the enemy faction.
- Cryocoolant projector: Autotargeting will now try to spread coolant on to all nearby targets instead of focusing the highest-flux one.
- Toroid Mortar: Fires an explosive ring of plasma. Somewhere between a torpedo and an energy weapon. Has a low rate of fire, high damage, and good range. Gains weak homing in synergy or universal slots.

NEEDS SPRITIN':
- Anaconda-class phase battlecruiser.
	- cryocooled armor
	- limited magazines
	- System: Temporal Siphon. Steals 20% of the timeflow from each hostile ship within range. 
	- Armament: 6x medium uni, 1x large uni, 4x small uni.
