Some fixes for new content.
- Excession no longer generates charge from shooting dead ships.
- Hullmod 

New: Ship. Get the [REDACTED] device, use it a few times, and look for a bar event on Granite.
Changes:
- Eidolon: DP increased (40 -> 45). Too obvious of a choice at 40 DP, particularly as a flagship due to its mobility.
- Apotheosis: DP increased (35 -> 38). A little bit overperforming for the cost, mostly because of its high dissipation and long range.


Todo, eventaully:
- Tuatara-class destroyer. 13 DP. Basically half a Crocodile. Two Taipan-6 missile pods and three nozzles. System is Arcmine Dispenser.
- Anaconda-class phase battlecruiser. System is temporal siphon; steals timeflow from nearby ships. Probably 1x large, 6x med?
- consider a line of synergy weapons (toroid mortars)
	- energy stats, fires a slow, guided, interceptable plasma ring
	- big aoe, real good energy damage (1000/shot, regens 1 every 10s?)
- Sonora-class utility cruiser. 1x large uni hardpoint, 2x medium energy, some PD mounts, 1x bay. Salvage gantry, repair gantry hullmod. Good base speed, probably? Maybe a lighter cruiser than the alligator.
