armor repairer: DP cost reduced to 1/1/2/3 (same as cryocoolant), smod bonus removes the cost. Increased frigate repair amount. Increased targeting range to 2000.
cryocoolant: smod bonus removes the cost, now provides 100/150/200/300 flat dissipation instead of 30% more. no longer penalized against larger targets. Increased targeting range to 2000.
flares: added DP cost (1/1/2/2), smod bonus removes cost. Adjusted flare numbers to 2/2/4/4.
