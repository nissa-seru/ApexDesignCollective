==== 1.2.3 ====
Fleshing out the relic guns and adding some relic hulls. I don't have anything else planned for the relic stuff at the moment, but I may add more if inspiration strikes.
New: (all need spawn rate checking)
- MHD Driver
- Plasmatic Repeater (needs sfx)
- Shrieker Torpedo Silo
- Shrieker Torpedo Rack
- Dadras-class destroyer
- Aizawa-class dreadnought
Changes:
- added a loot cargo listener to ensure that Taipan VLS cells never end up in anyone's cargo, ever
- Rotary AM Flak: new sounds courtesy of meso, and significantly reworked explosion visual effects
- Wailer MRM Pod: increased flight time by 2 seconds to ensure it reaches its listed range even if fired directly away from the target.
==== 1.2.2 ====
- fixes an issue with the most recent combat activators version that caused some nozzle systems to never find valid targets
- cryocoolant manual targeting now considers a selected ally a valid target, even if they have zero flux
- harmonic dart cannon: improved sound and visual effects
- Taipan VLS: reduced ammo regeneration by 33%. Overbuffed this one last patch.
