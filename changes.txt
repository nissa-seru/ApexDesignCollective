1.0.8d: Pre-tournament Shame Patch
Changes:
- Entropy Consolidator (system on Caiman and Komodo): Normalized damage reduction values to match the vanilla damper. Frigates and destroyers get 66% reduction, cruisers and capitals get 50%. Previous value was 60% for all hull sizes. (The description said 70%, and was wrong. Whoops.)
- Komodo: Tightened up weapon arcs slightly and reduced flux dissipation (750 -> 700).

TODO:

- touhou mod needs guns added to python system list
- ed shipyard too


NEEDS SPRITIN':
- Tuatara-class destroyer: Aiming for 13 DP. 2 nozzles.
	- Same rapid nozzle hullmod as komodo.
	- Equipped with (1? 2?) Thundercloud SLRM tubes. Thundercloud Strategic Long-Range Missiles deploy a cluster of mines at their targets. Mines produce a large but relatively weak shockwave. (250 energy[?], no falloff)
	- System is Arcmine Dispenser.
	- slots depend on missile firepower. low on PD because of arcmine system.
- Anaconda-class phase battlecruiser.
	- cryocooled armor
	- limited magazines
	- System: Temporal Siphon. Steals 20% of the timeflow from each hostile ship within range. 
	- Armament: 6x medium uni, 1x large uni, 4x small uni.
- Sonora-class siege carrier: Aiming for 50dp. 3 nozzles.
	- Siege Avionics: Increases the range of all fighter weapons by 50%, and all bomber weapons by 100%. Reduces fighter engagement range by 50%.
	- Fleet Repair Gantry: Increases fleet recovery rate by 25%. Each additional gantry provides half the benefit.
	- Armament: 2x Ultrachromatic Pulse Cannon, 4x wings, 1x large uni, 2x med synergy, 3x med hybrid (one rear-facing), PD mounts.
	- Ultrachromatic Pulse Cannon: 1k range, 2 barrels, 750 energy, 200 flux/sec, 7.5 reload. Poor accuracy on subsequent shots. Hits to shield heavily dampen velocity. Hits to armor reduce effective armor.
	- System: Fleet Reinforcement. Synchronizes fleet defense routines. Allied ships in range take less shield and armor damage. Prevents hard flux dissipation while active.
